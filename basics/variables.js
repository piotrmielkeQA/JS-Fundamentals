// Mutability: Variables declared with let can be reassigned, meaning you can change the value they hold after they have been defined. On the other hand, variables declared with const cannot be reassigned. Once a const variable has been assigned a value, it remains constant throughout the program execution.

let variable1 = "Variable1";
let variable2 = 54+25;

variable1 = "Variable"

console.log(variable1)
console.log(variable2)
